# bladeRF-FSK #

## Project Overview ##

The bladeRF-fsk project is a simple frequency shift keying (FSK) based software modem
implemented entirely on the host PC side in C code. The project uses libbladeRF to
transmit/receive samples with a bladeRF device. A USB 3.0 port is not required when using
this modem. The modem supports both bladeRF 1.0 and bladeRF 2.0 devices. The project also
contains a MATLAB/Octave model and simulation of the physical layer (PHY) portion of the
modem.

The top level bladeRF-fsk C program demonstrates the functionality of the modem in a
simple bladeRF-to-bladeRF data transfer program. This program can transmit/receive both
text (like a chat program) and binary files (like a file transfer program) with a raw
link rate of 250 kbps. To properly demonstrate the program, two instances of the program
must be run with two separate bladeRF devices (loopback is not supported).

The modem modulates with continuous-phase frequency shift keying (CPFSK). Baseband I/Q
CPFSK samples are sent to the bladeRF device, inside which they converted from digital
to analog, mixed with quadrature RF carriers, and transmitted through the air.
Received signals are mixed with quadrature RF carriers to downconvert to baseband I/Q,
sampled with an ADC, and sent to the host PC program over the USB connection.

The physical layer code features an FIR low-pass filter, power normalization, preamble
correlation for signal detection, CPFSK modulation/demodulation, and scrambling. The
link layer code features framing, error detection via CRC32 checksums, and guaranteed
delivery of frames via acknowledgements and retransmissions.

This project is meant to be an experimental example and should not be treated as a
rigorous modem.

## Dependencies ##

- [libbladeRF]

[libbladeRF]: ../../libraries/libbladeRF

## Build Instructions ##

The program may be built/installed as host software that uses libbladeRF. Follow the build instructions
listed in [bladeRF/host/README.md].

[bladeRF/host/README.md]: ../../README.md

_NOTE_: Release builds are recommended for this program.
More info: The receiver thread inside phy.c eats up a lot of CPU resources with DSP.
Debug builds do not contain compiler optimization, so running a debug build may
cause RX overruns (i.e. received samples get dropped) which can cause the modem to fail.
If you want to check the %CPU that this thread uses, you can run bladeRF-fsk_test_suite
which contains a function phy_receive_test() that simply runs the receiver thread for
some time. Monitor the CPU usage of the threads using the linux command:
```
top -H -p $(pidof [path to build/output executables]/bladeRF-fsk_test_suite)
```
When bladeRF-fsk_test_suite gets to phy_receive_test(), be sure to watch the CPU usage.

### Build Variables ###

Below is a list of project-specific CMake options.

| Option                                            | Description                                                 |
| ------------------------------------------------- |:------------------------------------------------------------|
| `-DBLADERF-FSK_BYPASS_RX_CHANNEL_FILTER=<ON/OFF>` | Bypass the RX low-pass channel filter. Default: OFF         |
| `-DBLADERF-FSK_BYPASS_RX_PNORM         =<ON/OFF>` | Bypass RX power normalization. Default: OFF                 |
| `-DBLADERF-FSK_BYPASS_PHY_SCRAMBLING   =<ON/OFF>` | Bypass scrambling in the PHY layer. Default: OFF            |
| `-DBLADERF-FSK_ENABLE_NOTES_LINK       =<ON/OFF>` | Print noteworthy messages from link.c. Default: OFF         |
| `-DBLADERF-FSK_ENABLE_NOTES_PHY        =<ON/OFF>` | Print noteworthy messages from phy.c. Default: OFF          |
| `-DBLADERF-FSK_ENABLE_DEBUG_ALL        =<ON/OFF>` | Print debug messages from all files & bladeRF. Default: OFF |
| `-DBLADERF-FSK_ENABLE_DEBUG_TEST_SUITE =<ON/OFF>` | Print debug messages from test_suite.c. Default: OFF        |
| `-DBLADERF-FSK_ENABLE_DEBUG_CONFIG     =<ON/OFF>` | Print debug messages from config.c. Default: OFF            |
| `-DBLADERF-FSK_ENABLE_DEBUG_LINK       =<ON/OFF>` | Print debug messages from link.c. Default: OFF              |
| `-DBLADERF-FSK_ENABLE_DEBUG_PHY        =<ON/OFF>` | Print debug messages from phy.c. Default: OFF               |
| `-DBLADERF-FSK_ENABLE_DEBUG_CORR       =<ON/OFF>` | Print debug messages from correlator.c. Default: OFF        |
| `-DBLADERF-FSK_ENABLE_DEBUG_BLADERF    =<ON/OFF>` | Print bladeRF debug messages. Default: OFF                  |
| `-DBLADERF-FSK_ENABLE_VERBOSE_BLADERF  =<ON/OFF>` | Print bladeRF verbose (and debug) messages. Default: OFF    |

Setting -DBLADERF-FSK_ENABLE_NOTES_LINK=ON will show you when a frame is received with
CRC errors. Setting -DBLADERF-FSK_ENABLE_NOTES_PHY=ON will show you when RX overruns
occur, meaning the PHY receiver thread could not process a set of samples fast enough
and samples had to be dropped.

## How to Run ##
To run the top-level bladeRF-fsk program with defaults, type into a terminal:
```
bladeRF-fsk
```
To see a list of configuration options and how to set them, type:
```
bladeRF-fsk -h
```
If you want to run on a specific device rather than the first available device, use the
`-d` option to specify the bladeRF serial number, which can be abbreviated.
Example (where `4e` is the first 2 characters of the serial number):
```
bladeRF-fsk -d *:serial=4e
```
By default the program uses the first available bladeRF device, gets TX input from stdin,
writes RX output to stdout, and uses a default set of transmit/receive frequencies and
gains, with automatic gain control on the RX side. TX gains may need to be tweaked for a
good connection with another bladeRF running bladeRF-fsk. To transfer files, use the '-i'
and '-o' options. If using stdin for tx data, the program will transmit data line-by-line.

The program runs until it gets an EOF in its TX input.

### Example: Text Chat Between BladeRFs ###
1) Be sure two bladeRF devices are plugged into your PC (or two separate PCs) with
   TX and RX antennas attached.

2) Run bladeRF-fsk on one of the devices:
```
bladeRF-fsk -r 904M -t 924M
```
3) Run bladeRF-fsk on the other device with opposite frequencies:
```
bladeRF-fsk -r 924M -t 904M
```
4) Type out a message on one device and press ENTER. A packet will be transmitted and the
   message will appear on the other device. Both sides can send/receive messages.
5) Press [CTRL-D] on Linux/OSX or [CTRL-Z then ENTER] to quit

If the sending device does not get any response from the receiving device, it will quit
the program. Try increasing the TX gain and run it again.

### Example: Transferring Files Between BladeRFs ###
1) Be sure two bladeRF devices are plugged into your PC (or two separate PCs) with
   TX and RX antennas attached.

2) Run bladeRF-fsk on one of the devices (receiver), with the output RX file specified:
```
bladeRF-fsk -r 904M -t 924M -o rx.jpg
```
3) Run bladeRF-fsk on the other device (sender), with opposite frequencies and the input
   TX file specified:
```
bladeRF-fsk -r 924M -t 904M -i puppy.jpg
```
4) The file will begin transferring, and progress will be printed in the terminal for the
   sending device.

5) Once the transmission is complete, press [CTRL-D] on Linux/OSX or [CTRL-Z then ENTER]
   on Windows to stop the program on the receiving end.

If the sending device does not get any response from the receiving device, it will quit
the program. Try increasing the TX gain and run it again.

## Known Limitations ##
1) The program does not currently support the use of an XB-200 transverter expansion
   board to transmit/receive at frequencies below 300MHz. In order to add XB-200 support,
   a new configuration option as well as functions from the "Expansion boards" section
   of the libbladeRF API would need to be added to the source code.

2) The program is currently unable to perform two file transfers in both directions
   simultaneously. Reason #1: The program runs until is gets an EOF in its TX input,
   meaning whichever side finishes transmitting its file first will quit and stop
   receiving. An EOF bit would need to be added to the link layer packet format in order
   to stop this behavior. Reason #2: The program doesn't seem to perform well during
   these simultaneous file transfers, and usually loses connection. Further investigation
   is required to debug this.

The modulation is performed at baseband by rotating the phase either counter-clockwise
(positive phase change = positive frequency) or clockwise (negative phase change =
negative frequency) around the IQ unit circle. Demodulation is performed by calculating
the phase for each sample based on its IQ angle, and measuring the change in phase over
the length of the symbol (positive change = positive frequency = 1, negative change =
negative frequency = 0).

A preamble is used for synchronization.
